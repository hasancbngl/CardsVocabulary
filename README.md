# CardsVocabulary

Cards Vocabulary app help to user to improve their vocabulary knowledge.

My second android project. I developed it with using java programming language  and Sql for the database in order to
add to information to save and edit the list. Pulled the words and definitons from .txt file.

Indeed,  finished that project while ago but while learning git had an issue than deleted the folder by mistake but 
there's no big difference anyway. :)
